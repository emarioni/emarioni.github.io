                    <h2>Hello, üñêÔ∏è</h2>
                    <p>
                        I'm Eduardo, a passive learner and sports fanatic ‚ú≠ starting their Software Engineering career üíªÔ∏è and soon to become a Computer Science Graduate üéì. I live in New
                        Mexico, currently serving my country in the United States greatest Air force, and will be in possession of my DD214 coming Spring 2021. I was born in Mexico and 
                        raised in Fort Worth, TX with my three older siblings. Undecided on what to do after High School, I decided to join the military as a Vehicle Technician. Before I 
                        knew it, I had orders to Germany. I married my High School sweetheart üë∞ and together, we started our new adventure in Europe. I have had the opportunity to travel the world, 
                        meet new people and experience different cultures. Since then, I have been in the Air Force for the past 5 years currently on my second deployment. We plan on starting a family
                        in the up coming year, but we do have two furr babies üê±üê± that always make us smile. My hobbies consist of drawing, reading üìñ, building things, sports üèà, video games, traveling, 
                        flying drones and coding/computer techy stuff üíª.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This site is my entry-level portfolio I built with the help of my classes and youtube tutorials. As I progress in my coding skills, I will continue to update my portfolio with 
                        new features and projects. Being a vehicle technician in the USAF with 6+ years have taught me some excellent troubleshooting skills. Although, I may not have much job coding 
                        experience. I am one very determined, fast-learner and hard working individual with a passion üíö for code and excellent problem-solving skills. I know this journey will be hard
                        and challenging but, as Tom Hanks once said; "If it wasn't hard, everyone would do it. It's the hard that makes it great." I am up for the challenge.                
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you would like to say hello üëã or get to know me more, visit my contact section and feel free to reach out to me via email or message. Thank You.

                    <h2>BMI Calculator</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project was for my CSCI 430, Mobile Computing course. I worked
                        on it with another classmate. It has a user registration page where 
                        you can create an ID and password. Then you are able to sign in using
                        your password. After the disclaimer page, you input your personal info
                        and then you arrive at the main menu selection. You have 4 options
                        to pick from. Update user information, New record, Graph and Suggestions.
                        This application is meant to keep track of your BMI and shows you data
                        and suggestions. This project is complete for the most part but, could
                        use some more work.

                    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
                    <p>
                        This project is more of a personal one with a little professionalism in it. I started
                        this project as a personal hobby and it evolved into my portfolio website for hiring managers
                        to look at. I wanted something that I would really enjoy, something that I would be thinking
                        about all day and excited to get home and work on. This has definetly done it for me. I am so 
                        fascinated by how fun it is to design a page to the smallest detail. I love drawing and this
                        feels like a different kind of drawing form, like drawing with a keyboard. Web developer/design
                        is definitely a career I am very interested in. This project is complete for now, but I do plan 
                        on making upgrades to it as I keep learning.

                        This project was also for my CSCI 430, Mobile Computing course. It is a simple two tab
                        site that describes how Amortization works and a calculator that will return a filled
                        out Amortization table for you. This project is still a working progress as it still
                        needs work.
